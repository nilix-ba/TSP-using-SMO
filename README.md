# TSP-using-SMO

In this problem, we attempt to solve TSP using Self-Organizing Map. How does it work? It's simple; first of all create random points and then update the neurons according to the SOM algorithm. All neurons are updated with different weights using the neighborhood function which determines how the winner neuron influences the others on the adaptive process (Here gaussian function was used). In short; we find the winner neuron and the winner neuron and its neighborhood are updated using the neighborhood function.
